##Introduction
------------------------------------------
This repository contains my solutions for the Google's CodeJam 2017. Unfortunately I didn't provide myself enough coding time for the competition (Online Qualification Round) , so only TidyNumbers solution is unabridged solution that I've developed in about two hours (including the initial solution and debugging and fixing corner cases) and also submitted during the competition. It passed both the small and big input test cases. The rest of the solutions that will be provided here in the future are drivative works that I've developed after the competition in unspecified amount of time.
